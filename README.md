# The Post’s Machine Reloaded: Design, Implementation and Programming of a Small and Functional CPU Prototype

This repository contains the complete original code for both the [first Spanish edition, free ebook](https://github.com/galaguna/Posts_Machine_Reloaded_Booklet/releases/tag/First_Spanish_Edition), in process of be published, and the [first English edition, free ebook](https://github.com/galaguna/Posts_Machine_Reloaded_Booklet/releases/tag/First_English_Edition), in process of be published too.

In the refered booklet, the complete development of the design, implementation and programming of the prototype for a small central processing unit (CPU) is presented, starting with an improved variant of the Post’s Machine. The Post’s Machine is a theoretical development similar to that of Alan Turing, the famous mathematician considered to be one of the fathers of modern computing, although developed by Emil Post in an entirely original and independent way. The Post’s Machine is much simpler than Turing's, therefore, given its relative simplicity, it allows those interested to be introduced, in a clear way, to the basic concepts related to the operation of any CPU. 

The development of the logical design of the corresponding digital system is explained, it is specified by means of Register Transfer Level (RTL) methodology, its codification is shown with VHDL language and it is implemented with the resources of a low cost FPGA development board. The prototype obtained could be used for the interested parties to experiment, in a very concrete and practical way, the concepts of micro-code, algorithm and programming, both in assembly language and in machine language.
  
Finally, it is demonstrated that it is possible to build, with relatively limited resources, a microprocessed system that allows the acquisition of the necessary knowledge and experience to be introduced in the field of design and application of modern digital systems. Therefore, this work can be used as a reference, both theoretical and practical, for any engineer, or computer and electronics amateurs, who wishes to go deeper into the details of the design and construction of a prototype for a simple but functional microprocessor. The material in this work can even be of great interest, in the academic environment, as a complementary textbook for the Advanced Logical Design, Microprocessing Systems and other related courses.
